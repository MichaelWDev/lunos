🌌 LUNOS.CHAT 🌌

Description:
Lunos.chat is a web application for people to communicate on.

The goal of this application is to offer complete security to its users. Private information is encrypted, and will not be sold off (unlike what other platforms do).

Inspiration stems from both the sci-fi and futuristic genre.

Users will be able to:

• Create/log-in their accounts.
• Talk on the public Lunos server.
• Create chat servers.
• Create voice channels.
• Create text channels.
• Create custom server roles.
• Create server permissions for roles.
• Kick users.
• Ban users.
• Unban users.
